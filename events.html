    <p class="events">We host a variety of events on campus throughout the year, which offer opportunities to get to know us and see our beautiful campus. The following events will be live and in person during the 2021-2022 academic year, with the exception of Explore and Social Justice Days. We're continuing the rigorous safety measures that have kept our community safe thus far, so visitors are required to wear a mask and present proof of either a full COVID-19 vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test taken within 72 hours of their visit</p>
